# undertale_techdemo

EDIT: I'm now currently not working on this project, since I got caught into new stuff, my interest from the game has lowered and the new ctrulib changes demand for a lot of alterations to the code (mainly on sound). If you want to continue the project, feel free to clone it and continue developing it.

Undertale Techdemo for 3DS

Made with ctrulib, sf2dlib, sftdlib, sfillib, and some sound examples from GBATemp (clank201).

All resources and sounds from Undertale by Toby Fox.

NOTE: To make this demo to work correctly, unzip the old version/release of the game into your "3ds" folder, or copy these files:

- undertale_techdemo.3dsx
- undertale_techdemo.smdh
- "data" folder
- "sound" folder

And place these files in a folder called "undertale_techdemo" (if you don't have it, create it on the "3ds" folder).

If you are looking to compile the demo yourself, please delete the "build" folder, since it may cause some problems.
