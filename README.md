# undertale_techdemo

We'll see how long this lasts, but for now, I'm making additions to this.

Undertale Techdemo for 3DS

Made with ctrulib, sf2dlib, sftdlib, sfillib, and some sound examples from GBATemp (clank201).

All resources and sounds from Undertale by Toby Fox.

NOTE: To make this demo to work correctly, copy these files:

- undertale_techdemo.3dsx
- undertale_techdemo.smdh
- everything under the 'romfs' folder. The "sound", "tex", and "font" folders.

And place these files in a folder called "undertale_techdemo" (if you don't have it, create it on the "3ds" folder).

The eventual goal is to get it to take unmodified files from the actual game and not be distributing modified versions of art/sound. For now, I'll include some assets in the actual releases for now. If you wish to grab the music files which are not on git, grab the Undertale Demo and grab house1.ogg. Though, hopefully all of the music in the demo will eventually be used.

If you are looking to compile the demo yourself, please run `make clean`, as otherwise there may be issues. (Or, at least, so said the person who had this previously.)

A binary release of the current progress comes when I feel like it.

A HUUUGE thanks for MerryMage for helping free my code from the curse of csnd. And to everyone who tolerated my stumbling.

I feel like I understand some things better now.
