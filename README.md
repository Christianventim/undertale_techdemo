# undertale_techdemo
Undertale Techdemo for 3DS

Made with ctrulib, sf2dlib, sftdlib, sfillib, and some sound examples from GBATemp (clank201).

All resources and sounds from Undertale by Toby Fox.

NOTE: To make this demo to work correctly, unzip the old version/release of the game into your "3ds" folder, or copy these files:

- undertale_techdemo.3dsx
- undertale_techdemo.smdh
- "data" folder
- "sound" folder

And place these files in a folder called "undertale_techdemo" (if you don't have it, create it on the "3ds" folder).

If you are looking to compile the demo yourself, please delete the "build" folder, since it may cause some problems.

EDIT: Currently deprecated since last ctrulib's update (I'm trying to fix it). Also, I need some more DETERMINATION to continue this, since 8chan and TF2C is taking me away
