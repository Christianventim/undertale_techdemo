We'll see how long this lasts, but for now, I'm making additions to this.

Undertale Techdemo for 3DS

Made with ctrulib, sf2dlib, sftdlib, sfillib, and some sound examples from GBATemp (clank201).

All resources and sounds from Undertale by Toby Fox.

NOTE: To make this demo to work correctly, copy these files:

- undertale_techdemo.3dsx
- undertale_techdemo.smdh
- everything under the 'romfs' folder. The "sound", "tex", and "font" folders.

And place these files in a folder called "undertale_techdemo" (if you don't have it, create it on the "3ds" folder).

If you are looking to compile the demo yourself, please run `make clean`, as otherwise there may be issues.
A binary release of the current progress comes when I feel like it.

A HUUUGE thanks for MerryMage for helping free my code from the curse of csnd. And to everyone who tolerated my stumbling.

I feel like I understand some things better now.
